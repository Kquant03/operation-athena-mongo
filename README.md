# Project Athena Source Code

This is a mixture of a repository that I built from scratch with Claude and then some open source code for MongoDB functionality. It was built on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database), deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) with the [Vercel + MongoDB integration](https://vercel.com/integrations/mongodbatlas). You can find the example code I used [here](https://github.com/vercel/mongodb-starter).

It runs with npm install and then npm run dev. If you want to adopt something like this, this entire project is running on Node 20. It's completely free on my end as long as the database size doesn't get too high. 

MongoDB and Vercel for the win.
