# MongoDB Starter â€“ Developer Directory

This is a mixture of a repository that I built from scratch with Claude and then some open source code for MongoDB functionality. It was built on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database), deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) with the [Vercel + MongoDB integration](https://vercel.com/integrations/mongodbatlas). You can find the example code I used [here](https://github.com/vercel/mongodb-starter).
